## How to contribute to Blowfish

### Bugs & other issues

#### Found a bug? üêõ

- **Ensure the bug has not already been reported** by searching [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/issues). If there's already an open issue, feel free to add any extra information you might have about the issue.
- If you're unable to find an open issue matching the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample**, **screenshot**, or a **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
- Where possible, use the bug report templates to create the issue. Avoid including descriptions like "bug", "feature", etc in the issue title as these will be handled by labels.

#### Have a patch that fixes an issue?

- Great! Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- All development occurs on the `dev` branch and new PRs should be forked from here.
- The commands `npm run example`, `npm run example:core`, and `npm run example:production` can be used to test local changes using the example site.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
- **Before submitting**, check the [coding conventions](#coding-conventions) section below to learn more about coding and commit message expectations.

### New features & enhancements

#### Do you intend to add a new feature, or change an existing one?

- Enhancements are welcome but before implementing any features, be sure to suggest your change by opening a [new discussion](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/discussions/new) about your idea. Enhancements are discussed to ensure they fit with the project's design intent and overall roadmap.
- Before opening a discussion, [check to see](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/discussions/categories/ideas) if a similar idea is already being discussed.
- All ideas and suggestions are welcome and will be judged on their merits.
- If the community supports your idea, go ahead and submit a PR with the implemented feature.

### Questions? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

- If you have a general question, these should be asked using [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/discussions). Feel free to open a [new discussion](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/discussions/new) to ask your question using the "Q&A" category.
- Be sure to check if your question has already been answered by searching [existing Q&A discussions](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Coding conventions

- Indent using 2 spaces (soft tabs).
- Put spaces between list items (ie. `[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (ie. `1 + 1`, not `1+1`) and inside go templating tags (ie. `{{< alert >}}`, not `{{<alert>}}`).
- Avoid code reuse in templates by extracting components into partials.
- Layout code in a logical manner that prioritises readability.
- Add comments when the intent of the code isn't immediately apparent or to break up large blocks of logic.
- Use relative paths to assets without including the preceding slash but, when referring to a folder, including a trailing slash (ie. `static/img/`, not `/static/img/` or `/static/img`).
- Any static text must be referenced using the `i18n` methods and included in the localisation assets.
- Commit often, preferring incremental changes rather than bundling everything into a single, large commit.

The project includes a Prettier config that helps to format code in line with these guidelines.

#### Commit message guidelines

- Use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) in PR messages to provide context.
- Clearly describe the change with a short summary in the first 72 characters.
- Place more detailed explanations in paragraphs below the summary, separated by a blank line.
- Use imperative language (ie. "Fix bug", not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug").
- Do not end the summary line with a period.
- Reference any issues fixed using their GitHub issue number.
